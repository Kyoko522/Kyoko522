# 💫 About Me:
I'm a Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University in my third year. I enjoy creating applications ranging from games to practical tools like flashcards and chess simulators.

When I'm not focused on schoolwork, you'll find me designing robots, working under the hood of a car, or coding with Arduino. I'm fascinated by AI and enjoy the perfect balance between solving complex programming challenges and getting my hands dirty with mechanical projects.

I thrive in collaborative environments where ideas can be openly discussed and tested. Gaming is another interest of mine — both playing and developing games that create engaging experiences.
              
My approach to computer science is versatile; I enjoy tackling different aspects of projects and paying attention to the details that make technology work smoothly. (Most times at least!)

Welcome to my github — I'm glad you're here!
